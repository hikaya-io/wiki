# How we work

## Our mission

We want to help nonprofits tell their stories through data and the use of open source technology.

## Our values

* We’re inspired by the values of companies like Basecamp, Buffer, and GitLab.
* We believe in cultivating a culture of curiosity and innovation at the workplace.
* We empower our teams to follow their passion through ownership of work and responsibilities.
* We value openness and honesty at the core of building strong relationships.
* We strive for quality over perfection to deliver workable solutions.

## Our approach

  * Design with the user
  * Take an iterative and agile approach
  * Build ownership at all levels
  * Promote data literacy in the products we design
  * Build on open standards to enable collaboration and contribution
