## Test Coverage

We aim to maintain a high level of test coverage for all our source code. Our standards are:
- Over 95% for all backend code
- Over 90% for all frontend code

We will include all of the following tests as part of our coverage:
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Periodic load testing

## Automated Test Cases

We perform end-to-end testing on all our applications. We use the `robot framework` to built automated test cases for UI testing. These automated test cases will be included as part of our CI/CD process and run on our `staging` and `dev` environments.
