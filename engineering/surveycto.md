# SurveyCTO

> SurveyCTO is a powerful, field-tested platform that allows you to collect high-quality data using mobile phones, tablets, or computersâ€”even when you're offline.

Form servers, or Survey Servers, provide a great opportunity to build data-oriented integrations.
We aim to load its data about "Forms" and their "Submissions" into some analytics-friendly, a relational DB, a non-relational DB, and provide data owners better control and visibility of the data they collected.

The list of submissions needs to be periodically updated. Daily is good enough.
