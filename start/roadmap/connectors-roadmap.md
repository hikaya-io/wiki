# Connectors Product Roadmap 2020 🗺️

With **Connectors**, we’re architecting a common data pipeline for nonprofits to manage their unstructured datasets by importing datasets from third-party data collection tools while hosting a series of pre-built connectors that let organizations integrate their ERP systems.

Here we present the **Connectors** roadmap for the next 6-12 months. This includes high level goals and features we would like to introduce during this period.
