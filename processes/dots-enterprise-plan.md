# How to add workspaces on the Enterprise plan

For workspaces that sign up for the **Dots** `enterprise plan`.

## User requests enterprise plan
A user will request to be upgraded to the `enterprise plan` by contacting us directly via email or the [contact form](hikaya.io/contact) found on our website.

Pricing for the `enterprise plan` will depend on the features they request as well as if they require a separate hosted version.
## Steps

1. Log in to the Dots BE environment and you would like to add the `enterprise plan` (I.e. [dots-be.hikaya.app/admin](dots-be.hikaya.app/admin) or [dots-be.hikaya.dev](dots-be.hikaya.dev))
2. Go to the `workspaces` model and find the workspace name you would like to upgrade and click on the `workspace name`
3. Scroll down and find the field called `subscription` and switch this from the current plan to `ENTERPRISE` and click `save`.
4. Go back to the Dots FE environment to confirm if that the workspace is now on the `enterprise` plan. This information can be found under the `info` icon in the top-right corner.
